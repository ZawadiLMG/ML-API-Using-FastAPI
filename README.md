# ML-API-Using-FastAPI
## **Machine Learning API using FastAPI to Predict Sepsis Data**

In this project, we create an API that can interact with a machine learning model. This is really useful in keeping the model's architecture confidential or sharing it with users who already use APIs. By deploying an API, this model can receive requests over the internet.

The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology of data science as below:

### Tasks
- To build an API integrating an ML model using FastAPI
- Build an ML model to predict the Sepsis data
- Build an API using Fast API to embed the ML model built

### General Process
- Pass data through a request;
- Get the data in using the API;
- Apply the necessary processing;
- Submit the processed data to the ML model to make the predictions;
- Process the predictions obtained and return them as the API's response ot the input request

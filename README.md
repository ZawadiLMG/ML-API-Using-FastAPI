## Project Description
<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Sepsis Prediction<a name="about-project"></a>

**Sepsis Prediction** This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution to predict whether a patient will develop sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes.
The project involves training several machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis based on various input features. These models are then deployed via an API, and a user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit to allow healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive predictions.

## Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Objectives**
Sepsis Prediction: Build a reliable and accurate ML model to predict sepsis, contributing to early detection and intervention.
Model Confidentiality: Ensure the ML model architecture remains confidential while providing prediction services through an API.
Accessibility: Enable users to interact with the sepsis prediction model via an easy-to-use API, making it accessible to those who already use APIs in their workflows.
Scalability: Develop an API that can handle multiple requests efficiently, ensuring it can scale as the number of users increases.

- **Page Configuration**
**The Streamlit page is configured with a title, icon, and wide layout for better user experience. The configuration is set using st.set_page_config().**

- **A title and introduction are provided to explain the purpose of the application. The markdown section gives users an overview of sepsis, the importance of early detection, and instructions on how to use the application.**

- **Input Form**
**The show_form function creates a form for users to input patient data. The form is divided into three columns to organize the input fields neatly. The features include:**

PRG (Plasma glucose)
PL (Blood Work Result-1)
PR (Blood Pressure)
SK (Blood Work Result-2)
TS (Blood Work Result-3)
M11 (Body mass index)
BD2 (Blood Work Result-4)
Age
Insurance

![App inputs](C:\Users\Zawadi\Desktop\Azubi\ML-API-Using-FastAPI\Utils\uoo.PNG)

**The form is submitted using a button, which triggers the prediction process.**
- **Making Predictions**
**Upon form submission, the input data is sent to the backend API for prediction. The application handles the response, displaying the prediction result or an error message if the request fails.**

![Successful response](C:\Users\Zawadi\Desktop\Azubi\ML-API-Using-FastAPI\Utils\successful response.PNG)

- **Dockerfile for API**
**Overview**
**The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for the Sepsis Prediction API. This image encapsulates all dependencies and configurations needed to run the API, ensuring a consistent environment across different deployments.**

- **Base Image**
**The base image used is python:3.12.2. This image includes Python 3.12.2 and provides a clean environment to set up the application.**

- **Copying Requirements File**
 **The requirements file, which lists all the dependencies for the project, is copied into the /tmp directory in the Docker image.**

- **Setting the Working Directory**
 **The working directory is set to /app, where the application code has been copied. This ensures that all subsequent commands are run in the context of this directory.**

- **Exposing the API Port**
 **The Docker container exposes port 8000, which is the port on which the API will be accessible. This allows external access to the API when the container is running.**

- **Running the Application**
 **The command to start the API is specified. uvicorn is used as the ASGI server to run the FastAPI application. The API will be accessible at host 0.0.0.0 on port 8000.**

- **Dockerfile for Streamlit Application**
- **Overview**
**The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for the Sepsis Prediction Streamlit application. This image encapsulates all dependencies and configurations needed to run the Streamlit app, ensuring a consistent environment across different deployments.**

- **Base Image**
**The base image used is python:3.12.2 This image includes Python 3.12.2 and provides a clean environment to set up the application.**
FROM python:3.12.2

- **Copying Requirements File**
**The requirements file, which lists all the dependencies for the project, is copied into the /tmp directory in the Docker image.**
COPY requirement.txt /tmp/requirement.txt


- **Installing Dependencies**
**The dependencies specified in the requirement.txt file are installed using pip.**
RUN python -m pip install -r /tmp/requirement.txt


- **Running the Application**
**The command to start the Streamlit application is specified. The main.py file is the entry point for the Streamlit app, and the app will be accessible at port 8501.**

- **Docker Compose Configuration**
**Overview**
**The docker-compose.yml file is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. In this project, Docker Compose is used to set up two services: the API and the Streamlit client. This setup ensures that both services can communicate with each other seamlessly within a shared network.**

![Code for Docker Compose File](C:\Users\Zawadi\Desktop\Azubi\ML-API-Using-FastAPI\Utils\doc compose.PNG)

- **Version**
**The version of Docker Compose being used is specified as 3.**
version: '3'


**Building and Deploying the Docker Containers**
**Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Building the Docker Containers**
First, I built the Docker images for both the API and the Streamlit client using the following commands:
This command reads the docker-compose.yml file and builds the Docker images based on the specified build contexts (./api for the API and ./frontend for the client).

2. **Starting the Services with Docker Compose**
After successfully building the Docker images, I started both the API and the Streamlit client services using Docker Compose:
This command creates and starts the containers for both services, ensuring they are up and running. Docker Compose handles the network setup, so both services can communicate over the defined mynetwork.

3. **Accessing the Streamlit Application**
Once the services were up, I accessed the Streamlit application via the provided link:
This link opens the Streamlit interface in a web browser, allowing users to interact with the Sepsis Prediction application. The application presents a user-friendly form where patient data can be entered to predict the likelihood of sepsis.
